            A Method for Deactivation and Deletion Policies
                    draft-brezorubio-wg-oblivion-00

Abstract

   The current method for opting out from a service are far from being
   standard.  This fact makes the process of deactivating or deleting an
   account from a website difficult to find since each platform provides
   the link in a different way.  This document defines a standard
   ("oblivion.txt") to help organizations to describe the steps to
   follow by a user for deactivating or deleting an account from their
   websites in a secure and standard way.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation and Previous Work

   Many of the standard interaction of end users with online services
   involve creating and managing personal accounts.  Even when the
   creation of these accounts may seem easy to control, generally, the
   deletion and deactivation of an account does not fulfill with any
   type of standards making each experience of look differently.

   Regarding this issue, there has been efforts to list the procedures
   followed by different platforms to conduct this task.  For example,
   the project JustDelete.me shows a list of direct links to deletion
   URLs on different platforms.  However, this process is mainly curated
   by contributors, which is an approach that does not scale well.

   In this document, we define a machine-readable and extensible way of
   communicating how users can interact with a service to deactivate
   their accounts or fully deleting them.  This standard is thought to
   assist companies on providing a transparent and reachable way of
   giving access to their opt-out procedures so as to give back to the
   users the right to keep control of their own digital footprint.

1.2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  The Specification

   This standard defines a text file to be placed in a known location
   that provides information for users and applications to assist them
   in the process of finding the tools to delete or remove accounts and
   services.

   The file is named "oblivion.txt", and this file SHOULD be placed
   under the Well-Known path ("/.well-known/oblivion.txt") [RFC5785] of
   a domain name or IP address for web properties.  If it is not
   possible to place the "oblivion.txt" file in the Well-Known path or
   setup a redirect, web-based services MAY place the file in the top-
   level path of a given web domain or IP address ("/oblivion.txt") as a
   fall back option.  For web-based services, the instructions MUST be
   accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol [RFC1945] as a

   resource of Internet Media Type "text/plain" with the default charset
   parameter set to "utf-8" per section 4.1.3 of [RFC2046].  For file
   systems and version control repositories an ".oblivion.txt" file
   SHOULD be placed in the root directory of a particular file system or
   source code project.

   This text file contains multiple directives with different values.
   The "directive" is the first part of a field all the way up to the
   colon ("Contact:").  Directives MUST be case-insensitive.  The
   "value" comes after the directive ("https://example.com/oblivion").
   A "field" MUST alway consist of a directive and a value ("Contact:
   https://example.com/oblivion").  An "oblivion.txt" file can have an
   unlimited number of fields.  It is important to note that you MUST
   have a separate line for every field.  One MUST NOT chain multiple
   values for a single directive and everything MUST be in a separate
   field.  Unless otherwise indicated in a definition of a particular
   field, any directive MAY appear multiple times.

2.1.  Scope

   An "oblivion.txt" file MUST apply to the domain in the URI used to
   retrieve it and to any of its subdomains or parent domains.  However,
   an "oblivion.txt" file that is found in a file system or version
   control repository MUST only apply to the folder or repository in
   which it is located, and not to any of its parent or sibling folders,
   or repositories.

   Some examples appear below:

   # The following only applies to example.com and subdomain.example.com

   https://example.com/.well-known/oblivion.txt

   # This only applies to subdomain.example.com but not to example.com

   https://subdomain.example.com/.well-known/oblivion.txt

   # This oblivion.txt file applies to IPv4 address of 192.0.2.0.

   http://192.0.2.0/.well-known/oblivion.txt

   # This oblivion.txt file applies to IPv6 address of 2001:db8:8:4::2.

   http://[2001:db8:8:4::2]/.well-known/oblivion.txt

   # This oblivion.txt file applies to the /example/folder1 directory.

   /example/folder1/oblivion.txt

Internet-Draft                     I-D                     December 2018


2.2.  Comments

   Any line beginning with the "#" (%x30) symbol MUST be interpreted as
   a comment.

   Example:

   # This is a comment.

   You MAY use one or more comments as descriptive text immediately
   before the field.  Parsers SHOULD associate the comments with the
   respective field.

2.3.  Separate Fields

   A separate line is REQUIRED for every new value and field.  You MUST
   NOT chain everything into a single field.  Every line MUST end either
   with a carriage return and line feed characters (CRLF / %x0D %x0A) or
   just a line feed character (LF / %x0A).

2.4.  Field Definitions

2.4.1.  Contact

   This directive allows you to provide an address where users CAN ask
   for additional information to delete their accounts.  The value MAY
   be an email address, a phone number and/or a contact page with more
   information.  The "Contact:" directive MUST always be present in an
   "oblivion.txt" file.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it
   MUST be begin with "https://".  Contact email addresses SHOULD use
   the conventions defined in section 4 of [RFC2142], but there is no
   requirement for this directive to be an email address.

   The value MUST follow the general syntax described in [RFC3986].
   This means that "mailto" and "tel" URI schemes MUST be used when
   specifying email addresses and telephone numbers.

   The precedence SHOULD be in listed order.  The first field is the
   preferred method of contact.  In the example below, the e-mail
   address is the preferred method of contact.

   Contact: mailto:oblivion@example.com

   Contact: tel:+1-201-555-0123

   Contact: https://example.com/oblivion-contact.html

2.4.2.  Deactivate

   The "Deactivate" directive is used for linking to the deactivation
   procedure.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it SHOULD
   begin with "https://".

   Hiring: https://example.com/deactivate-account.html

2.4.3.  Delete

   The "Delete" directive is used for linking to the deletion procedure.
   If this directive indicates a web URL, then it SHOULD begin with
   "https://".

   Hiring: https://example.com/delete-account.html

2.5.  Encryption

   This directive allows you to point to an encryption key that any user
   or application SHOULD use for encrypted communication.  You MUST NOT
   directly add your key to the field.  Instead the value of this field
   MUST be a URI pointing to a location where the key can be retrieved
   from.  If this directive indicates a web URL, then it SHOULD begin
   with "https://".

   When it comes to verifying the authenticity of the key, it is always
   the user's responsibility to make sure the key being specified is
   indeed one they trust.  Users MUST NOT assume that this key is used
   to generate the signature file referenced in Section 2.4.6.

   Example of a PGP key available from a web server:

   Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt

   Example of a PGP key available from an OPENPGPKEY DNS:

   Encryption: dns:5d2d37ab76d47d36._pgp.example.com?type=OPENPGPKEY

   Example of a PGP key being referenced by its fingerprint:

   Encryption: openpgp4fpr:5f2de5521c63a801ab59ccb603d49de44b29100f

2.5.1.  Policy

   This directive allows you to link to where your privacy policy and/or
   terms and conditions policy is located.  This can help end users to
   understand what are the conditions to opt-out in the service.  If

   this directive indicates a web URL, then it SHOULD begin with
   "https://".

   Example:

   Policy: https://example.com/privacy-policy.html

2.5.2.  Signature

   This directive allows you to specify a full URI (as per [RFC3986]) of
   an external signature file that can be used to check the authenticity
   of a "oblivion.txt" file.  External signature files SHOULD be named
   "oblivion.txt.sig" and SHOULD be placed under the Well-Known path
   ("/.well-known/oblivion.txt.sig").  If this directive indicates a web
   URL, then it MUST be begin with "https://".  This directive MUST NOT
   appear more than once.

   It is RECOMMENDED to implementors that this directive is always used.

   When it comes to verifying the authenticity of the file, it is always
   the user's responsibility to make sure the key being specified is
   indeed one they trust.

   Here is an example of an external signature file.

   Signature: https://example.com/.well-known/oblivion.txt.sig

2.6.  Example of an "oblivion.txt" File

   # Our oblivion address

   Contact: mailto:oblivion@example.com

   # Our PGP key

   Encryption: https://example.com/pgp-key.txt

   # Our privacy policy

   Policy: https://example.com/privacy-policy.html

   # Deactivate from our service

          Figure 2: Internal Location of the "oblivion.txt" File.

3.1.  Web-based services

   Web-based services SHOULD place the "oblivion.txt" file under the
   Well-Known path (e. g., "https://example.com/.well-known/
   oblivion.txt").  An "oblivion.txt" file located under the top-level
   path SHOULD either redirect (as per section 6.4 of [RFC7231]) to the
   "oblivion.txt" file under the Well-Known path or be used as a fall
   back.

3.2.  Filesystems

   File systems SHOULD place the "oblivion.txt" file under the root
   directory (e. g., "/.oblivion.txt", "C:\.oblivion.txt").

   example-directory-2/

   example-directory-3/

   example-file

3.3.  Internal hosts

   An ".oblivion.txt" file SHOULD be placed in the root directory of an
   internal host.

3.4.  Extensibility

   Like many other formats and protocols, this format may need to be
   extended over time to fit the ever-changing landscape of the
   Internet.  Therefore, extensibility is provided via an IANA registry
   for directives as defined in Section 6.2 of this document.  Any
   directives registered via that process MUST be considered optional.
   To encourage extensibility and interoperability, implementors MUST
   ignore any fields they do not explicitly support.

4.  File Format Description and ABNF Grammar

   The expected file format of the "oblivion.txt" file is plain text
   (MIME type "text/plain") as defined in section 4.1.3 of [RFC2046] and
   is encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629] in Net-Unicode form [RFC5198].

   The following is an ABNF definition of the "oblivion.txt" format,
   using the conventions defined in [RFC5234] and [RFC5322].

   body = *line (permission-field eol) (signature-field eol) *line

   line = *1(field / comment) eol

   eol = *WSP [CR] LF

   field = acknowledgments-field / contact-field / deactivate-field /
   delete-field / encryption-field / policy-field / ext-field

   fs = ":"

   comment = "#" *(WSP / VCHAR / %xA0-E007F)

   contact-field = "Contact" fs SP (email / uri / phone)

   email = <Email address as per [RFC5322]>

   phone = "+" *1(DIGIT / "-" / "(" / ")" / SP)

   uri = <URI as per [RFC3986]>

   deactivate-field = "Deactivate" fs SP uri

   delete-field = "Delete" fs SP uri

   encryption-field = "Encryption" fs SP uri

   policy-field = "Policy" fs SP uri

   signature-field = "Signature" fs SP uri

   ext-field = field-name fs SP unstructured

   field-name = <as per section 3.6.8 of [RFC5322]>

   unstructured = <as per section 3.2.5 of [RFC5322]>

   "ext-field" refers to extension fields, which are discussed in
   Section 3.4 of this document

5.  Security Considerations

   Organizations creating "oblivion.txt" files will need to consider
   several security-related issues.  These include exposure to sensitive
   information and attacks where limited access to a server could grant
   the ability to modify the contents of the "oblivion.txt" file or
   affect how it is served.  Organizations SHOULD also monitor their
   "oblivion.txt" files regularly to detect tampering.  Organizations
   SHOULD also ensure that any resources such as web pages, email
   addresses and telephone numbers references by an "oblivion.txt" file
   are kept current, are accessible and controlled by the organization,
   and are kept secure.

   To ensure the authenticity of the "oblivion.txt" file, organizations
   SHOULD sign the file and include the signature using the "Signature"
   directive (Section 2.4.6).  As stated in Section 2.4.4 and
   Section 2.4.6, both encryption keys and external signature files MUST
   be loaded over HTTPS.

   Websites SHOULD reserve the "oblivion.txt" namespace to ensure no
   third-party can create a page with the "oblivion.txt" name.

6.  IANA Considerations

   "example.com" is used in this document following the uses indicated
   in [RFC2606].

   "192.0.2.0" and "2001:db8:8:4::2" are used in this document following
   the uses indicated in [RFC6890].

6.1.  Well-Known URIs registry

   The "Well-Known URIs" registry should be updated with the following
   additional values (using the template from [RFC5785]):

   URI suffix: oblivion.txt

   URI suffix: oblivion.txt.sig

   Change controller: IETF

   Specification document(s): this document

6.2.  Registry for "oblivion.txt" Header Fields

   IANA is requested to create the "oblivion.txt Header Fields" registry
   in accordance with [RFC8126].  This registry will contain header
   fields for use in "oblivion.txt" files, defined by this
   specification.

   New registrations or updates MUST be published in accordance with the
   "Expert Review" guidelines as described in section 4.5 of [RFC8126].
   Any new field thus registered is considered optional by this
   specification unless a new version of this specification is
   published.

   New registrations and updates MUST contain the following information:

   1.  Name of the field being registered or updated

   2.  Short description of the field

   3.  Whether the field can appear more than once

   4.  The document in which the specification of the field is published

   5.  New or updated status, which MUST be one of the following:

       1.  "current".  The field is in current use.

       2.  "deprecated".  The field is in current use, but its use is
           discouraged.

       3.  "historic".  The field is no longer in current use.

   An update may make a notation on an existing registration indicating
   that a registered field is historical or deprecated if appropriate.
